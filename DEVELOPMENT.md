# Development Notes

These notes were inspired in the work by Jeffrey Kantor (jeff at nd.edu), and the original version can be found [here](https://github.com/jckantor/CBE30338/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## For Contributors

Please read the following notes if you wish to contribute to this repository.

1. Contributions to this reposistory are welcome. 

2. While there are no specific guidelines, please take into account the following considerations:
* All contributions must be under terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution Noncommericial ShareAlike License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/);
* Include authorship information directly in any contributed notebooks, e;
* If you wish to raise an issue with regard to any of the materials in the repository, please use the github 'issues'mechanism. That will provide a means to track, make revisions, and close issues in a clear and transparent manner.

3. Keep in mind that the target audience for these notebooks are people  learning basic concepts of chemical engineering for the first time, such as students early in the first 2-3 years of undergraduate study, professionals in other disciplines wishing to extend their skills, or others seeking a self-study guide to chemical engineering. **This is not a course in Python coding.** So keep the coding as straightforward as possible.

4. For serious development, you will likely want to install a Python/Jupyter development environment such as the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com) distribution. 

5. However, it is also entirely possible to develop notebooks using the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). First, using git, clone a repository into a Google Drive directory. From Google Drive, you can open and close notebooks directly in Colaboratory. Using git (or a github desktop application), you can issue add branches, commit changes, and issue pull requests as needed.
